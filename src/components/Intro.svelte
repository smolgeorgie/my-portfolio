        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I craft websites that are fast, inclusive, and don't fall apart when sneezed on. Whether I'm untangling some spaghetti code, nudging pixels into place with CSS, or giving semantic structure the love it deserves, I will always return to the basics. I am slightly obsessed with accessibility and performance, as I believe that everyone deserves to experience the same journey of the web.</p>
